  **攝影書籍設計**<br>「我的『野餐』，是一場對方為我精心策畫的神祕旅程。」— 吳美琪⁣


  ⁣吳美琪最新攝影集，以野餐暗喻人世的宴席風景，透過對物的癡迷，探討人與人之間的關係與羈絆。


  **PICNIC Photobook Design**<br>“My ‘picnic’ is a mysterious journey carefully
  planned for me by the other.” - Wu Meichi⁣⁣


  As a metaphor of earthly feasts and scenery, this photobook “PICNIC” explores
  the relationship and fetters between people, through artist Wu Mechi’s
  obsession with objects.⁣


  This time, Wu Meichi uses still life images to express abstract emotions. She
  observes that no matter if the power is equivalent or not, we must get used to
  and maintain peace, even though it is sometimes partially forced or violently
  forced to accept kindness by others.⁣


  Starting with a private picnic date, she created a series of splendid collage
  images to symbolize the process of emotional changes between people at
  unpredictable moments; maybe it’s due to the weather, the tone, or perhaps
  it’s not for any reason. She accepts the fact that people’s psychological
  state is not controllable, which made her turn into the image creation world
  of collage and landscaping.⁣


  In the process of unbridled creation, she has regained the possibilities of
  picnics. Under the little picnic mat, despotism, hesitation, sorrow and joy,
  impermanence…etc. is buried within. It is hard to experience the feelings
  until you encounter the scenario in person.⁣


  Wu Meichi (b.1989) is experienced in setting up incredible vivid light and
  shadow scenes by hand. The illusion of space is beyond normal understanding.
  In the process of dividing dimension, common objects are transformed into a
  still life in a strong manner. The artist is like the creator with a childlike
  heart, never willing to stop after she starts to play. ⁣
