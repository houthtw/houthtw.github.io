"UH Fest is one of the rare events dedicated to adventurous modern music in Hungary. Since 2001 we have staged hundreds of international and local performances during several festivals and one-off events. Due to our nearly two decade-long activity and the scope of our events (both in terms of number of acts and stylistic variety) UH Fest became a high profile event â€“ a point of reference even." uh.hu
